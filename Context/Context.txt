SYSTEM / CONTEXT:
You are building a fully production-grade, feature-complete, modern full-stack application called CodeRedLink — a futuristic AR-era URL shortening platform built using Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Neon Postgres + Prisma + Tailwind + ShadCN UI + Framer Motion.

This is not a basic CRUD toy. You must deliver a visually stunning, ultra-immersive, bleeding-edge experience that feels like living in a world where Apple Vision Pro, Meta Ray-Bans, AR/VR spatial computing, and content-responsive ambient RGB lighting are the default reality. The app should feel like liquid glass cyberpunk minimalism with extreme responsiveness, soft neon lighting, reflective UI surfaces, refraction effects, physically-based animations, magnetic UI pull forces, spring-like feedback, modern tactile motion, and immersive sound cues. A product that sucks the user in and makes them feel at home, part of the interface.

DESIGN DIRECTION:

Visual tone = Liquid Glass + Neon Cyberpunk + Spatial UX.

Apple Liquid UI style UI glass components with blur, reflection, bloom, chromatic lighting gradients.

Lighting must react to motion, input focus, and navigation actions.

Use RGB-accented ambient glows and physics-based UI transitions.

Use Framer Motion for buttery smooth spring-based animations.

Use real-time atmospheric lighting tied to element colors.

Use bold high-contrast typography.

Buttons feel physical, magnetic, and glass-like with depth.

The experience should feel like it belongs inside Vision Pro’s floating windows with reflections and depth parallax.

Responsive design that scales from phone → laptop → AR spatial layout.

No boring flat bootstrap-tier layouts. This is power.

CORE FEATURES (MUST implement exactly)
Backend/API Requirements

API Endpoints:

Method	Route	Purpose
POST	/api/links	Create link (long URL + optional custom code)
GET	/api/links	List all links
GET	/api/links/:code	Stats for specific link
DELETE	/api/links/:code	Soft delete a link
GET	/healthz	Health check JSON
Redirect Route

GET /:code →

Look up code

If not found: 404 page

If found: increment totalClicks, update lastClickedAt, return 302 redirect to targetUrl

URL Shortening Rules

Codes must match [A-Za-z0-9]{6,8}

Custom code optional but must not collide → return 409 conflict if exists

URL validation required

DB Schema (Prisma)
model Link {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  code          String   @unique
  targetUrl     String
  totalClicks   Int      @default(0)
  lastClickedAt DateTime?
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
  deletedAt     DateTime?
}

Pages
Route	Content
/	Dashboard with link form + table
/code/[code]	Stats page
/:code	Redirect
/healthz	System status JSON

STARTER PROMPT (use after context to make agent start coding)

STARTER TASK PROMPT:
Build the full CodeRedLink application end-to-end using the requirements above.
Use the provided DATABASE_URL environment variable to connect Prisma to Neon Postgres.
Initialize the Prisma schema, run migrations automatically, generate API endpoints, create the full UI, implement AR-era immersive animated design, and deploy the finished app to Vercel.
Ensure the UX reflects spatial computing / liquid glass / neon cyber-aesthetic with rich motion and ambient lighting.
After generating the full stack, run auto-tests with all endpoints and deliver a working deployed URL.

Begin by:

Installing dependencies

Setting up Prisma and DB models

Creating all API routes

Building animated UI

Deploying to Vercel

Returning full repo code
